 2. CMD `sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker`
 3. CMD `sudo service docker restart`
 4. Relogin by user ${USER}
 
#### Scripts explanation 

##### Dockerfile
 1. Avoid using user root
 2. Volumes should be mounted for presistence and capability
 3. Allocate port 8080 to http service   
 4. Nginx service should be run as a front process instand of daemon (cause by docker's mechanish,
 if there is only one daemon running in a container, it will quit.)

##### run.sh
 1. `-d` command defines container running in backgroup
 2. `--rm` command means delete the container when it quit 
 3. `--add-host` command can add items to images'`/etc/hosts`
